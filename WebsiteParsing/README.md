# Website Parsing

The point of this exercise is to benchmark your ability to write code, and documentation. Please make sure your solution is of production quality. You should be comfortable checking your solution into your primary code base. Use proper names, check for errors, etc. Your code and documentation should be representative of how you code on the job.


## Constraints

- Your solution must be written in Python, preferably python 3.x.
- You may use any libraries and tools of your choice.
- You must provide instructions on how to set up, and run your code. Please be very specific. If you need any dependencies to be installed, specify exactly how to do so. Specify how to run your program exactly.
- Your program must run on a recent version of linux and macOS.


## Problem

The file `websites.txt` contains a list of websites that have been found by one of our search bots. Your objective is to parse these websites in order to determine if they are e-commerce sites.

Your result should be in tabular format: a tab separated file with the following columns:

| website             | e-commerce |
|:--------------------|:-----------|
| solidswiss.cd       | true       |
| myparisianlife.com  | true       |
| photographyblog.com | false      |


## Submission

The expected submission method is a git repository. Please email us a link: interview-dd@surya-soft.com. If you'd like to use a private repo and give us read access, that's perfectly fine. The username on Github and Bitbucket to give access to is `gps`. The username on Gitlab is `gp5`.

If that's not an option (please explain why), email us a zip file.

Your repository must contain:

- Result file
- Source code
- A detailed README.

Your README should at a minimum contain:

- Clear instructions on how to install any dependencies your code may have
- Clear instructions on how to run your code
- A description of how you approached the problem. For example, what design choices did you make? Why? Are there any known limitations in your solution? Why? What are some possible ways to overcome those limitations? Are there any further improvements that could be made?

Your submission will be evaluated for its correctness (i.e. how many errors are in your output), as well as the quality of your code and documentation. Please note that a submission without a proper README will not be considered - it is as important as the code you submit.
