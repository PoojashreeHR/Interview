Goal
====

The purpose of this problem is for the interviewer to get a quick sense of how you write code. This problem should not take you more than a couple of hours to solve.

Although this is a toy problem, please make sure your solution is of production quality. You should be comfortable checking your solution into your code base. Use proper names, check for errors, etc.


Constraints
===========

- Your solution must be written in either Python or Java.
- You may use any libraries and tools of your choice.
- You must provide a solution that can be run on a unix system (preferably OS X 10.9.5, but any unix system will do).
- You must provide instructions on how to build and run your code.
- Your solution must finish running in under 10 seconds (assuming a 16 Mbps down network connection). Hint: concurrency.


Submission
==========

The best way to submit a solution is to put it up on a public Github or Bitbucket repository and send me a link to it. If that's not an option, a zip file should be sent.
